# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
In this projected we helped Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for a shcool district, clean, sort, and analyzed two data sets containing information of different schools and their students. 

The analysis consited of:

- Generating a school district summary (number of students, number of schools, total budget, score averages, passing percentages)
- Generating a school summary (student count per school, budget per student, score averages per school, passing percentages per school)
- Finding high and low performing schools 
- Finding average math and reading scores by grade
- Grouping scores by school spending per student
- Grouping scores by school size
- Groupong scores by school type

After the completion of the above, we were informed that reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appeared to be altered, and our analysis had to be modified so the results exclude data of that specific group of students.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After completing this, we will repeat the school district analysis, and recreate the metrics previously found.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?
